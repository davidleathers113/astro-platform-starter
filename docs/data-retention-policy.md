```sql
-- Rate limiting cleanup (24 hours)
DELETE FROM api_rate_limits 
WHERE window_start < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Old CSRF tokens (6 hours)
DELETE FROM csrf_tokens 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 hours';
```

#### Weekly Cleanup Processes
```sql
-- Email tracking cleanup (90 days)
DELETE FROM email_tracking 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

#### Monthly Cleanup Processes
```sql
-- Inactive leads cleanup (24 months)
DELETE FROM leads 
WHERE updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 months'
AND status IN ('archived', 'inactive');
```

### 4.2 User-Requested Deletion

#### GDPR Deletion Process
1. **Identity Verification**: Confirm user identity via phone/email
2. **Data Location**: Identify all records associated with user
3. **Deletion Execution**: Remove data from all applicable tables
4. **Confirmation**: Send deletion confirmation email
5. **Audit Trail**: Log deletion action for compliance

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long do these requests take?**
A: Most requests are completed within 3-5 business days. Complex requests might take up to 30 days (the legal maximum).

**Q: Do these services cost anything?**
A: No, exercising your data rights is always free.

**Q: How do you verify my identity?**
A: We primarily use the phone number you provided when you submitted your debt relief inquiry. This helps us locate and verify your information.

### Data Export Questions

**Q: What format is my data in?**
A: We provide data in JSON format, which is readable by humans and can be easily imported into other systems.

**Q: How do I open a JSON file?**
A: You can open JSON files with any text editor (like Notepad), or view them in a web browser. Many online JSON viewers make the data even easier to read.

A: Download links expire after 7 days for security reasons. If your link expires, just submit another export request.

**Q: Can I get my data in a different format?**

### Data Deletion Questions

**Q: Can I undo a deletion request?**
A: No, deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. That's why we ask you to carefully consider this choice.

**Q: Will you stop contacting me if I delete my data?**
A: Yes, once your data is deleted, we will have no way to contact you and all communications will stop.

**Q: What if I submitted multiple forms?**
A: Our deletion process will find and remove all records associated with your phone number across all our systems.

**Q: Can I delete just some of my data?**
A: Currently, our deletion process removes all your personal data. If you only want to stop certain types of communications, consider using the "object to processing" option instead.

### Communication Preferences

**Q: Can I stop marketing emails but keep service-related communications?**
A: Yes! You can either:

- Submit a data rights request asking to object to marketing communications
- Contact us to update your communication preferences

    <p class="leading-relaxed">
        DebtFreedom is not a lender and does not provide loans. We offer debt settlement services by negotiating with creditors on your behalf to reduce unsecured debt balances.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
        Our program is designed for individuals experiencing legitimate financial hardship who cannot meet their minimum payment obligations. Not all clients complete the program. Clients who do complete the program typically experience a 25-40% reduction in debt after fees over 24-36 months.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
        Debt settlement may negatively impact your credit score and ability to obtain credit. When you stop making payments to creditors, they may continue collection activities, including possible legal action. Settled debts may result in tax consequences; please consult a tax professional.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
        Our services are not available in all states. We do not assume consumer debt, make monthly payments to creditors, or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting, or legal advice. Please consult appropriate professionals for such services.
    </p>
